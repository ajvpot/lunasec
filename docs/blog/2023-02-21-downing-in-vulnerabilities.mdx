## Are you drowning in vulnerabilities?
Talking about vulnerabilities is too terse, so let’s talk about boats instead!

If your boat had a hole in it, you would probably patch that hole as fast as you could. You wouldn’t want your boat to take on water and sink, right?

For a boat that is supposed to be out at sea for months a hole in your boat spells disaster, but what if your boat didn’t need to sail for months? What if you had a row boat you took out occasionally to do some fishing and, since that hole is actually pretty small, you only really notice it when you bring your boat to shore and see a bit of water

When are you going to fix that hole? Right then and there? Tomorrow? A week from now? A month?

While you would still technically call that hole in your rowboat a “breach" that lingo doesn’t quite translate to the security world. A “breach” refers to a known compromise of a system. A breach is the actual action performed by a hacker to exploit a vulnerability. Often the vulnerability being exploited is one that is already known to exist (as opposed to a zeroday).

## Your boat is taking on water

Let’s relate this back to the world of security.

A hole in a boat is similar to a vulnerability. Your boat’s hull is supposed to protect you from the water that is always trying to force its way in. Any chance water gets it will pour in at full force. Just like, when there is a vulnerability in your code, hackers will try to use it to get into your company.

The laws of physics dictate how likely water will affect your boat, but with security we don’t quite have the same level of understanding. (It's too abstract.)

Like water, a hacker is going to find the way in that gives them the least resistance. If an unpatched Apache Struts instance is running inside of one of the world’s largest credit company you can be sure that a hacker will exploit it. There is a clear path for the hacker to gain money and/or influence.

Continuing this line of thinking, a vulnerability like a Regex Denial-of-Service (DOS) in an internal web application is not going to give a hacker meaningful leverage because there is just too much resistance for achieving their goal. (It could still cause you grief though.)

## Patching holes in your boat

There are a number of models that have been created to try to categorize and reason about vulnerabilities that an attacker might use (CVSS, EPSS, Attack framework?).

Unfortunately, these frameworks in practice do not quite capture the nuance of the different types of holes that can exist in code. Teams (or often times an individual) that manage vulnerabilities at a company find themselves almost exclusively chasing down fixes for holes in their “fishing rowboat” rather than focusing on fixing holes in their more important “ships” or mission critical services that process sensitive information.

It is ironic that even though vulnerability scanning is almost ubiquitous at companies they still struggle with locating and fixing them. Log4Shell, possibly the worst vulnerability ever discovered, had taken companies weeks or months to even remotely begin to understand how badly they were affected.

Fixing the Log4Shell vulnerability is still a process that is underway for some companies, and because this was in Java, a language used extensively by older, larger businesses, it still poses a major threat.

## Full sail ahead

We have been studying this space for a while now and it has become obvious to us that there is just simply no way to know how badly a vulnerability affects a company without significant effort from the security team. CVSS scores are seemingly arbitrary and with the prolific use of libraries in code, each with their own set of vulnerabilities, and the noise is deafening to a security engineer’s day to day work.

Being security engineers we understand what actually protects companies, and it comes in the form of building threat models and implementing security controls. Chasing down vulnerabilities is far too often a wild goose chase, even when the problem that you actually should have been caring about was a bear that was hiding in the bushes. Being distracted by honking geese is exactly what a hacker wants you to do to make their job easier.

We have an immense amount of empathy for security engineers who are fighting the good fight of trying to protect their companies in meaningful ways. This is why we have been building a product to address these day to day problems experienced by our allies on the front lines of the war with package vulnerabilities.

We are in the process of building a vulnerability search engine to quickly locate vulnerabilities that matter for a particular company as well as an AI chat bot to quickly find information regarding a particular vulnerability. Our API is completely open for use as well which we have found to be the most asked for feature from existing tools which they have not been able to deliver on.
