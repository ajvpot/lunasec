After the Log4j maintainers released version 2.15.0 to address the Log4Shell vulnerability, an additional attack vector
was identified and reported in [CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046). We tested
and confirmed that even log4j `2.15.0` is vulnerable to a denial of service (DOS) attack under
certain conditions.

Also, the previously recommended temporary mitigation for versions `2.10.0 <= Apache log4j <= 2.14.1` using the `noMsgFormatLookups`
flag was found to still be vulnerable to full RCE under the same specific conditions.

It was not readily apparently from reading [the CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046) what specifically was affected, or how this vulnerability is actually
triggered, so we wrote this post to help explain.

Fortunately the community has been hard at work reacting to these updates. A fork of [christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app](https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app) [added some
changes](https://github.com/kmindi/log4shell-vulnerable-app/commit/e539f7e9a0c81e2c580d63caff5f4eae14033f19) to demonstrate
the specific scenario in which this newly found CVE could affect an application.

## Conditions for the vulnerability
Our testing confirmed that applications that customize the log4j log format to include something written by an attacker
could still be vulnerable even with the `noMsgFormatLookups`.  This shows the weakness of this mitigation and the need to update log4j, preferably to `2.16.0`.

### Example vulnerable code
In these changes, the `noMsgFormatLookups` mitigation was included on log4j 2.14.1.

```bash
# Add environment variable as the currently official workaround for vulnerable versions of log4j2 (e.g. 2.14.1)
ENV LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS true
```

And the Log4j2 properties config includes a custom layout pattern:

```bash
# ...
# vulnerable in 2.14.1 even with ENV LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS true
appender.console.layout.pattern = ${ctx:apiversion} - %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n
# ...
```

Now, instead of directly logging the attacker controlled input as with the previous vulnerability like this:

```ts
@GetMapping("/")
public String index(@RequestHeader("X-Api-Version") String apiVersion) {
    logger.info("Received a request for API version " + apiVersion);
    return "Hello, world!";
}
```

The attacker would have to get their malicious string into something embedded in the log layout pattern: the `ThreadContext` value:

```ts
@GetMapping("/")
public String index(@RequestHeader("X-Api-Version") String apiVersion) {

    // Add user controlled input to threadcontext;
    // Used in log via ${ctx:apiversion}
    ThreadContext.put("apiversion", apiVersion);

    // Notice how these changes remove apiVersion from directly being logged
    logger.info("Received a request for API version");
    return "Hello, world!";
}
```

:::info Vulnerable App Log4j version

This vulnerable application was running with Log4j version `2.14.1` which is still vulnerable to the RCE even
_before_ the `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` mitigation.

:::

Running this vulnerable server and exploiting the vulnerability with our [log4shell cli tool](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/tree/master/tools/log4shell)
we observed that RCE was still possible in versions `2.10.0 <= Apache log4j <= 2.14.1`:

[![Log4j RCE on log4j 2.14.1 with mitigation](/img/log4shell-CVE-2021-45046-exploitation-with-mitigation.png)](/img/log4shell-CVE-2021-45046-exploitation-with-mitigation.png)

The server is still vulnerable even with `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` enabled because the Pattern Layout has been modified
to include a reference to a Thread Context value. It appears that referencing Thread Context values in this way bypasses
the logic for disabling JNDI lookups when formatting a message. The [CVE report](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046)
outlines this as well the other types of formatting types:

> This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses
a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern
(%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern.

We were not able to achieve RCE when using `%X, %mdc, or %MDC`, however we still do not consider these as safe to include
when running a Log4j version `< 2.16.0`. To understand more about the Log4j Thread Context map, please refer to the [docs](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/thread-context.html).

If you have previously used `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` to mitigate the log4shell vulnerability, in certain conditions
this will not be sufficient to protect your code from RCE. Refer to our [mitigation guide](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide)
for additional steps you can take to remediate the impact of Log4Shell.

## DOS Vulnerability still present in 2.15.0
The less impactful part of this CVE, important if you have updated your Log4j version to `2.15.0` as many users have now done, is that there is a possible denial of service (DOS)
attack.  This screenshot shows the

[![Log4j DOS on log4j 2.15.0 with mitigation](/img/log4shell-CVE-2021-45046-dos-with-mitigation.png)](/img/log4shell-CVE-2021-45046-dos-with-mitigation.png)

However, in our testing we did not find this DOS to be resource consuming as it seemed that the infinite loop created by recursively
resolving `${ctx:apiVersion}` was identified by the program and errored out.

Log4j `2.16.0` completely mitigates this issue by `removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default`.

We continue to recommend _not_ using `%m{nolookups}`, which we outline in our [mitigation guide](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide), as we have also
proved the vulnerability is still exploitable with a Pattern Layout such as:

```
appender.console.layout.pattern = ${ctx:apiversion} - %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m{nolookups}%n
```

`%m{nolookups` will only apply to the content being logged in the call to `logger.info()` and will not apply to the
resolving of `${ctx:apiversion}` which will contain our payload.
