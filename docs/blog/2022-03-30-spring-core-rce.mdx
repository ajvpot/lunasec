There are currently two RCE vulnerabilities being discussed on the internet. Most of the people talking about them
believe they're talking about "Spring4Shell", but in reality they're swapping notes about [CVE-2022-22963](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22963).

### TL;DR

Two RCEs exist.

We're unsure if the RCE in Spring Core is exploitable yet (dubbed "Spring4Shell"), while the [second RCE](#cve-2022-22963) in Spring
Cloud Function (less widely used) is valid and has been given a proper CVE ([CVE-2022-22963](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22963)).

<!--truncate-->

## Background

The situation is confusing because both vulnerabilities are in popular Java libraries published by Spring (Spring Core
and Spring Cloud Function). Further, this situation is made worse by the lack of a CVE to differentiate the two bugs.
Anybody searching for "Spring RCE" online is going to find the RCE results for the less popular Spring Cloud Function
library.

They won't be able to find information validating Spring4Shell because it's still an _unconfirmed_ vulnerability. There
is no CVE to track it because nobody is certain if there is a problem. It's all speculation and screenshots on Twitter/GitHub.

Even the name "Spring4Shell" was only picked because Spring Core is as ubiquitous of a library similar to how
log4j was (which spawned the infamous [Log4Shell vulnerability](https://www.wired.com/story/log4j-flaw-hacking-internet/)).

What is important to remember is that this vulnerability is *NOT* as bad a Log4Shell. Any attack scenario, once discovered,
is going to be more complex and have more mitigating factors than Log4Shell did because of the nature of how deserialization
exploits work in Java.

With Log4Shell exploitation was trivial and an exploit could be written in seconds that worked on most apps.

With Spring4Shell exploitation requires deep Java knowledge to get a functioning POC. It also requires certain features,
such as caching, to be enabled in Spring before an app is vulnerable. We don't have all the details yet, but we know
enough to feel confident that this isn't the "next Log4Shell" (despite what other blogs may be telling you).

### About Us

Why is our blog any different?

Well, we're a team of Security Engineers with experience in this space. In addition to writing a
[mitigation guide for Log4Shell](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide), we've also been
validating bug reports professionally for years. We helped run the Bug Bounties at
Uber and Snapchat which both had significantly more "invalid" reports to review than "real" ones. Because of that, we've
gotten very good at verifying that an exploit is a problem _before_ we ever sound the alarm.

As developers and security engineers, we're committed to only publishing the facts and our thoughts from analyzing them.

Until we determine more details, we won't be able to tell you anything with absolute confidence yet. How bad could this
be? Pretty bad, or nothing at all!

We won't know until we've invested more time though, so we encourage you to [get notified automatically](#get-notified-automatically)
when we publish updates.

## Overview of Vulnerabilities

- [Spring4Shell](#spring4shell): An _unconfirmed RCE_ in *Spring Core* <=5.3.17. We're investigating this currently.
- [CVE-2022-22963](#cve-2022-22963): A _confirmed RCE_ in *Spring Cloud Function* (<=3.1.6 and <=3.2.2).

## Context to Tame the Chaos

Trying to understand what information is "real" and what mitigations actually work is very difficult for vulnerabilities
without a CVE. That's especially true when the
[Spring developers themselves](https://twitter.com/hacksilon/status/1509117953064812547) are denying that there is a problem.

We've done enough analysis on this to be _concerned_ about the possibility that this is **potentially a big problem**.
We won't say that if it's _an issue worth worrying about_ until we have a concrete understanding of the exploit
scenarios. We believe that there _is_ some form of RCE in Spring core (i.e. Spring4Shell), but we just don't know if
it's easily "remotely executable" or not yet. That context is very important to remember!

### Deserialization alone is not a CVE

Why not declare this a problem immediately and add to the panic? Well, by itself, Code Execution isn't terribly
concerning. JavaScript still has the `eval` function included in every Node.js server or browser, but it's not
considered a security problem until an attacker has a way to feeding string input into `eval` with content they control.

In order to achieve that, for most applications, an attacker would have to be able to modify the application's source
code directly in order to give themselves access to execute `eval`. And, at that point, they wouldn't need `eval` anymore
because they can just put in their own code anyway!

That's what why security experts call them "Remote Code Execution" (RCE) attacks. We're only ever concerned when an
unauthorized user is able to *Remotely* execute code. That's what made Log4Shell
such a bad RCE vulnerability because developers log user-controlled variables (like usernames) all the time!

### Are you feeling Deja-vu?

There are a lot of similarities between Spring4Shell and Log4Shell. Back in December we were the first team to write
about the (at the time speculated) [Java RCE vulnerability in log4j](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day) floating around
on Twitter.

We initially named that vulnerability "Log4Shell" because, at the time,
[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) hadn't been published nor had the Apache team
published about any security notices about the issue).

And, just like then, misinformation was able to spread quickly and easily. It's much easier to photoshop a
screenshot showing an exploit and "redact the details" than it is to investigate a security vulnerability in a large
code base like Spring Core. It's also easy to tell people how to "fix" the vulnerability without any proof that the
mitigations are effective. (Which is why a [2nd CVE was published in log4j](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-update-on-cve-2021-45046/).)

Users on Twitter have been calling this possible RCE "Spring4Shell" to differentiate the RCE vulnerabilities. We're
doubling down on that term, in lieu of a proper CVE, to help users search for it separately from the other RCE mentioned
in this post.

Fortunately, we're a team of Security Engineers skilled in reviewing, validating, and writing up summaries on Bug Bounty
reports containing only basic information. We're happy to use that skill to dig in, understand, and publish our analysis
of the vulnerability for others to review.

## Spring4Shell

On March 29th, 2022, a set of Tweets (now deleted) were published from a Chinese Twitter account showing screenshots of a
new POC 0-day exploit in the popular Java library *Spring Core*. These reports are still unconfirmed, and we are actively
investigating the exploitability of this potential vulnerability.

There is not currently a CVE associated with this
vulnerability, but it has been being referred to as "Spring4Shell" by users on Twitter.

### Our Analysis

The speculation around this RCE is because of a
[change that was made to Spring Core](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7f7fb58dd0dae86d22268a4b59ac7c72a6c22529)
the deprecates an old "exception cloning" function that uses Java serialization and deserialization. This is problematic
because deserialization with untrusted string values, in Java, _does_ allow an attacker to gain RCE.

However, in this case, there are mitigating factors because of where this function is exposed. By default, it's only
exposed in the `@CacheResult` annotation ([code](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/02d3e00d33a578fb776cc2c65a9c15d9a75b2072/spring-context-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/cache/jcache/interceptor/CacheResultInterceptor.java#L125))
which requires an exception to be thrown and _then_ cached. Even if this vulnerability is exploitable, it will not be as
easily exploitable as [Log4Shell](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day) was.

We're still actively reviewing this code and testing payloads to understand the attack scenarios involved. Once we have
more details, we'll be updating this post to keep everybody informed. We've been posting small updates and details in
[this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/LunaSecIO/status/1509084844042510336) since we started reviewing this last
night.

### Get Involved

We've gone ahead and written an ["Example Vulnerable Application" on GitHub](https://github.com/lunasec-io/spring-rce-vulnerable-app)
for this vulnerable deserialization RCE attack. That repo does not currently contain a working POC or any information
about _how to exploit this_, but it does provide a way to help reduce the uncertainty around this by testing payloads
that could work.

If you have any insights or discoveries to share, please [email us](mailto:contact@lunasec.io) with them to help get
verified information to developers. You can also mention us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LunaSecIO). We're happy to
retweet anything you share with us if it's valuable.

## CVE-2022-22963

To add even further confusion to the "hype" around this, there _is_ a
[confirmed CVE](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/29/cve-report-published-for-spring-cloud-function) in Spring that was published on
March 29th, 2022 _also_! That CVE is being tracked as
[CVE-2022-22963](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22963), and it affects the *Spring Cloud Function* library
_only_ which is a separate Java library from *Spring Core*. This vulnerability currently has a *CVSS score of 5.7* and
has known POCs available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bytehx343/status/1509034539330732033) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/dinosn/CVE-2022-22963) ([another](https://github.com/RanDengShiFu/CVE-2022-22963)).

### Our Analysis

This vulnerability is real. If you're using the Spring Cloud Function library, you should upgrade to 3.1.7+ or 3.2.3+ to
mitigate this RCE.

There are likely mitigating factors that you can use to determine if you are vulnerable or not based
on your usage, but we're not currently publishing details about that in this post. (We're trying to help reduce the
uncertainty around Spring4Shell currently.)

If you'd like to contribute any specific information about this vulnerability, we encourage you to add it to this blog
post directly by
[adding it yourself on GitHub](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/blob/master/docs/blog/2022-03-30-spring-core-rce.mdx)!
Once you do, please send us a Pull Request for us to review and land.
