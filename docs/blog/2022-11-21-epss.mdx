## Vulnerability Severity Scoring

Security folks are all familiar with [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document), a framework used by
NVD to try to assign a quantifiable severity score to vulnerabilities. We also know to take it with a grain of salt.
The score doesn't always map well to how likely the vulnerability is to have an impact on you.

## EPSS is an attempt to quantify how likely an exploit is

When we see a high CVSS score, we are often left wondering: "What is the actual risk of this?" The EPSS score, by contrast,
is an attempt to quantify how likely it is that vulnerability is to actually be exploited in the wild. The score is a probability
of the estimated likelihood of exploitation expressed from 0 to 1 or 0% to 100%.

It stands for "Exploit Prediction Scoring System."

## Who does it
EPSS scores are published by the EPSS volunteers. The API is provided by [FIRST](https://www.first.org/about/).
They've [made scores available](https://www.first.org/epss/data_stats) for **all CVEs in the published state**.


## How is it generated
The **EPSS is generated by machine learning (ML).** If you ask us, the documentation could be a little more up front about that.

The model itself is proprietary, full stop.[^2] Too bad, because we would love to get our hands on it.

So what data does it use? Well, it's a combination of public and proprietary data. Here's a list of some of the data sources.
If you jump to the end there, you'll see that the private data is also probably the most crucial: **real world information from
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.**

:::info Official source list [^3]
* MITRE’s CVE List - Only CVEs in the “published” state are scored
* Text-based “Tags” derived from the CVE description and other sources talking about the vulnerability
* Count of how many days the CVE has been published
* Count of how many references are listed in the CVE
* Published Exploit code in any of: Metasploit, ExploitDB and/or Github
* Security Scanners: Jaeles, Intrigue, Nuclei, sn1per
* CVSS v3 vectors in the base score (not the score or any subscores) as published in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
* CPE (vendor) information as published in NVD
* Ground Truth: Daily observations of exploitation-in-the-wild activity from AlienVault and Fortinet.
:::
It makes sense. If you have real world data about how much a vulnerability is really being exploited, as tracked by real humans
through these SIEM tools, you've got a pretty good idea of how much a vulnerability actually matters. You can close the loop.

Naturally, as this data changes, the score is recalculated. This seems to happen roughly daily, at least for important vulnerabilities.

## How to access it
There's a free, public [JSON API](https://www.first.org/epss/api). Pretty straightforward. Let's ask it about everyone's favorite
vulnerability, [Log4Shell](../log4j-zero-day).

:::note API Response for Log4Shell
```json title="curl https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss\?cve\=CVE-2021-36942 "
{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-36942",
  "epss": "0.263270000",
  "percentile": "0.969920000",
  "date": "2022-11-20"
}

## What doesn't it do

### Environmental score
EPSS does not consider any variables related to the environment. By this, I mean there is no "frontend score" or
"backend score". It's just a single, one dimensional value spit out by the algorithm.

That's too bad for us, because one of the problems we are trying to solve with [LunaTrace](/pages/lunatrace/overview/introduction/)
is tuning our vulnerability prioritization to consider the environment the code is running in. We are working hard to build our own source
of signal for that.

### The result is opaque
CVSS scores are calculated based on a limited set of inputs and the mathematical formula can be evaluated by a human.

In contrast, the machine learning based approach of EPSS is more opaque. The model is not open source, and it is more difficult
to introspect the results. The only output of the model surfaced to consumers is the EPSS score itself.

## Is EPSS relevant

The shortcomings of CVSS and existing scanning tools are pretty well known, and in fact, we are trying to build a business
disrupting that. As far as we can tell, EPSS is a good idea and a needed step on the way to less bogus work for security engineers.



Once we get more of a feel for the data over the next month or so, we'd like to integrate showing EPSS scores into [LunaTrace](/pages/lunatrace/overview/introduction/).
After all, it's free and very easy for us to do. Please let us know if this is something you're excited about.
