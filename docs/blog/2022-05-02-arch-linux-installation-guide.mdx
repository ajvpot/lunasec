## BTW we use Arch

Here at LunaSec we've been busy hacking away at some exciting products, we've also onboarded a couple new team members WOOHOO ü•≥! Through the onboarding process we realized there was a great opportunity to
release our developer environment setup as a guide for the community.

We hope this guide helps encourage anyone
looking to start their journey into the world of Arch Linux and provides confidence to any teams considering Arch as a potential development environment.


## Why Arch is the best operating system for developers?
Here's a few of the reasons why decided to use Arch as our development environment
- We have direct visibility and control down to the kernel
- We know what's on our system and only use what we deem necessary
- We can configure our environments to meet security standards quickly and seamlessly
- We have access to the latest packages for development

We found arch to be that sweet spot between, security, accessibility and culture. For us using secure, open source software
that is constantly updated is our baseline. We found that Arch was the best choice for meeting each of these requirements.

## Preparing for the install

If you're ready to make the jump, go ahead and grab the version of [Arch](https://archlinux.org/download/) you would like to install. Create a bootable USB of the Arch Image you downloaded.
(You can try using [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) for linux or [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) for windows to make your USB boot image )
:::note
If your computer has safe boot you're going to want to go into your bios and disable it so we can load the USB
:::
## What We're Installing
- A UEFI boot partition using [systemd-boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot)
- An Arch Linux partition with [BTRFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Btrfs). Encrypted with [LUKS](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup) luks2


## Beginning The Install
Plug in your Arch usb image from the previous step and boot into it from your bios. From here we'll be using the Arch terminal.

We recommend to do the install via ssh to make life easier copying over commands.
To do this we'll connect to the internet using the [iwctl](https://man.archlinux.org/man/community/iwd/iwctl.1.en) tool to connect to our wifi.

Open up the iwctl tool

    iwctl

Search for your wireless adapter

    device list

Scan your local networks with your wireless adapter (wlan0)

    station wlan0 get-networks

Connect to your network

    station wlan0 connect YOUR_NETWORK

:::note
If your network is seperated with a space use quotes for "YOUR NETWORK"
:::

Once connected exit iwctl

    exit

Verify your connection works

    ping google.com

## Enabling SSH

Now that our machine is connected to the internet let's enable the SSH protocol and connect to it from our outside computer. This will make copying commands from the guide that much easier.

Start SSH

    systemctl start sshd.service

Set a password for root so we can ssh

    passwd

Find the machine's IP Address

    ip addr show

Now go to your other computer and connect via SSH (You'll be prompted for the root password you just set)

    ssh "root@<IP-OF-THE-FIRST-PC>

## We're connected via ssh and ready to do the following
- Create a Systemd boot partition
- Create a Linux Filesystem partition for Arch
- Encrypt our Filesystem Partition with LUKS
- Create BTRFS Sub Volumes on our Linux Filesystem partition
- Install Arch with recommended PKG's


## Create the Boot and Filesystem partitions

First let's identify the drive we are looking to install Arch on

    lsblk

This will bring up the drive in, our case since we're using a Thinkpad X1's and the drive shows:

    nvme0n1

:::note
For this guide we'll be using the **nvme0n1** naming convention, use it as a reference but be sure to replace it with your drive's name.
:::

The following commands will create the two partitions we want for our boot and filesystem.

    gdisk /dev/nvme0n1

This will begin the gdisk program / prompt. Let's begin creating the
EFI partition (choose size 550M and hex code EF00):

    Command (? for help): o
    Command (? for help): n
    Enter
    Enter
    +550M
    EF00

The Boot Partition should now be created.
Let's create the File system partition.

    Command (? for help): n
    Write the new partitions to disk:
    Enter
    Enter
    Enter
    Enter

    Command (? for help): w

Now let's verify that our two partitions exist.

    lsblk

You should be able to see the two partitions available as **/dev/nvme0n1p1** and **/dev/nvme0n1p2**.

## Encryption

Now that we have our two partitions, we are going to encrypt the container for our root file system.
Below is the command to encrypt that partition using LUKS.

    cryptsetup --cipher aes-exts-plain64 --hash sha256 --use-random --verify-passphrase luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/nvme0n1p2

Now we'll open the encrypted partition with:

    cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 luks

:::note
("luks" is just a placeholder, you can use a name of your choice, but remember to continue with your naming convention if changed):
:::

## File System Creation
Format the EFI partition with FAT32 and give it the label EFI:

    mkfs.vfat -F32 -n EFI /dev/nvme0n1p1

Format the root partition with BTRFS and give it the label ROOT.

    mkfs.btrfs -L ROOT /dev/mapper/luks

:::note
If you didn‚Äôt open the LUKS container under the name ‚Äúluks‚Äù you must adjust the command accordingly
:::

## Create and Mount Sub Volumes

Create sub volumes for root, home, the package cache, snapshots and the entire BTRFS file system:

    mount /dev/mapper/luks /mnt
    btrfs sub create /mnt/@
    btrfs sub create /mnt/@swap
    btrfs sub create /mnt/@home
    btrfs sub create /mnt/@pkg
    btrfs sub create /mnt/@snapshots
    umount /mnt

:::note
If you don‚Äôt want to use a swap file, it is not required to create and mount the sub volume @swap.
:::

Mount the sub volumes:

    mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@ /dev/mapper/luks /mnt
    mkdir -p /mnt/{boot,home,var/cache/pacman/pkg,.snapshots,btrfs}
    mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@home /dev/mapper/luks /mnt/home
    mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@pkg /dev/mapper/luks /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg
    mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@snapshots /dev/mapper/luks /mnt/.snapshots
    mount -o noatime,nodiratime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvolid=5 /dev/mapper/luks /mnt/btrfs

Mount the EFI partition

    mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot

:::note
Optional - The following is for those wanting to use a swapfile
:::

Create swap file (taken from Btrfs - Swap file and Swap file):

    cd /mnt/btrfs/@swap
    truncate -s 0 ./swapfile
    chattr +C ./swapfile
    btrfs property set ./swapfile compression none
    dd if=/dev/zero of=./swapfile bs=1M count=<FILE-SIZE-IN-MiB> status=progress
    chmod 600 ./swapfile
    mkswap ./swapfile
    swapon ./swapfile
    cd -

## Base System and /etc/fstab
We will be installing Arch Linux with the packages we need to get started.
For our machine we will be using [intel-ucode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/microcode) as the X1 has an intel CPU.setup

:::note
If your machine has an amd cpu, please replace **intel-ucode** with [amd-ucode](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=amd-ucode).
If you're looking for another text editor or any other package you want to install with Arch here is the place to do so, just add it to the command below.
:::

    pacstrap /mnt linux linux-firmware base btrfs-progs intel-ucode nano networkmanager git

Generate /etc/fstab:

    genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

## System Configuration
Here's where we'll be managing system configurations, in our case we're doing this as an American user,
for those of you reading outside the US, feel free to set language and keyboard bindings here to a format that works for your machine.

CHROOT into the new system:

    arch-chroot /mnt/

Set the hostname:

    echo <YOUR-HOSTNAME> > /etc/hostname

Set locale:

    echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf

Uncomment the following rows of /etc/locale.gen:

    en_US.UTF-8.UTF-8

Generate locale:

    locale-gen

Define hosts in /etc/hosts:

    <ip-address>	<hostname.domain.org>	<hostname>
    127.0.0.1	<YOUR-HOSTNAME>.localdomain	<YOUR-HOSTNAME>
    ::1		localhost.localdomain	localhost

Set the root user's password:
(Set a solid password as you will be signing into the machine as root for post install configuration)

    passwd

## Initramfs
Configure the creation of initramfs by editing /etc/mkinitcpio.conf. Edit the line HOOKS=... to:

    HOOKS=(base keyboard udev autodetect modconf block keymap encrypt btrfs filesystems resume)

:::note
resume in the above hooks is for those of you setting up a swap partition. If you don't intend to use swap, you can simply remove it.
:::

Recreate initramfs:

    mkinitcpio -p linux

## Boot Manager

Install systemd-boot:

    bootctl --path=/boot install

Create file /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf and fill it with:

    title Arch Linux
    linux /vmlinuz-linux
    initrd /intel-ucode.img
    initrd /initramfs-linux.img
    options cryptdevice=UUID=<UUID-OF-ROOT-PARTITION>:luks:allow-discards root=/dev/mapper/luks rootflags=subvol=@ rd.luks.options=discard rw

:::note
Optional - If you are using a swap add the following to the options flag. You wall also need to follow this guide to calculate your [offset](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation_into_swap_file_on_Btrfs)
:::
    resume=/dev/mapper/luks resume_offset=<YOUR-OFFSET>

Now we need to provide the UUID of our root partition

    blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/sda2

Replace the placeholder for UUID-OF-ROOT in /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

Edit file /boot/loader/loader.conf and fill it with:

    default  arch.conf
    timeout  4
    console-mode max
    editor   no

Lastly, we'll exit chroot, unmount our partition and reboot.

    exit
    umount -R /mnt
    reboot

## Congratulations, you now have Arch running on your laptop!
