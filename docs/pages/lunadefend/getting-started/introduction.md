:::tip Try out the live demo
The easiest way to see LunaDefend in action is to check out our [Live Demo app](https://app.lunasec.dev).
Just create a new user, input some data,
and try out LunaDefend.  To understand what is happening under the hood and what makes this special, read our [demo app documentation](https://www.lunasec.io/lunadefend/overview/demo-app/overview/).
:::

### Local Demo
You can run the same demo app locally with just a single command:

```shell
npx @lunasec/cli start --env demo

# Note: You have to have Docker and NPM installed for that this to work.
```
