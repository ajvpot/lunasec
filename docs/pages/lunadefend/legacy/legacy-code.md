## Naming Convention Changes

The original LunaDefend project started out under the project name LunaSec, as the company has grown and the product matured, we decided to formalize the product stack as LunaDefend. Because of this change you may find sections of the code and commands still referencing the previous lunasec. We wanted to give context to any users or developers curious as to our naming references and conventions.
