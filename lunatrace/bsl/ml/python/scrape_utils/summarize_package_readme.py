initial_template = """I'm going to show you a readme from a software package. Explain the use case of the package in two sentences or less,
 with a specific focus on the general purpose and usage of the library in the most analytical terms, no marketing speak. You're also welcome to use your 
prior knowledge if you're familiar with the package. For instance, if I asked you analyze the use case of the node package Express, which I'm sure you're familiar with,
it might look like this. Your response should be like this one, which explains which environment the library is useful for (backend server), what language (javascript), 
and exactly what it could be used for. Example: "A webserver framework designed for building servers in Node backends using Javascript. 
It can be used to serve single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs on the internet."

An explanation of the Fastify framework, for instance, 
would be identical, because the use case of the two libraries is the same. Don't mention the license, the creators name, or anything that isn't relevant to what the library is used for.
