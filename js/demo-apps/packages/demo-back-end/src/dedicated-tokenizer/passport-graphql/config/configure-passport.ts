  // will be set at `req.user` in route handlers after authentication.

  // In order to restore authentication state across HTTP requests, Passport needs
  // to serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  The
  // typical implementation of this is as simple as supplying the user ID when
  // serializing, and querying the user record by ID from the database when
  // deserializing.
